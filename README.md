What is this?
-------------

This directory holds the source code that was the result of the
presentation on Service API security at OpKoKo 17.2, Sk√∂vde.

Since the presentation, it has been expanded to contain a proper
identity service, that support the OAuth2 client_credentials grant
type , found in folder "IdentityService".  The code that we created in
the presentation, is found in folder "ProductsService".

## Run the code

To run the unit tests, open a terminal window and type:

```shell
cd Tests
dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
```

To run the system tests, you will need both a running identity and
product service:

```shell
cd ProductsService
dotnet run
```

```shell
cd IdentityService
dotnet run
```

Note the host and port where the product and identity service starts
(we will assume http://localhost:5000, and http://localhost:4000,
respectively.)

Update field `baseUri` in class `SystemTests` to point to the URI of
the running product service.  Also update the `tokenUri` field in
class `TokenHttpClient` to point to the URI of the identity service.

Run the system tests:

```shell
cd Tests
dotnet test --filter Category=System
```
